# SightReadingGenerator

A program to semi-randomly generate sheet music to help musicians practice sight reading

## How to use

You will need to have python installed to run this program. Instructions on how to do so can be found at [Python's official installation docs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) or one of the many third party guides online. From this Github page, select the most recent release from the right sidebar. After clicking on it, download the two files whose name start with `sightreadinggenerator` into the directory where you'll be working. It is recommended to create a [python virtual environment](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv) before you begin any new python project. Once you've done that and activated the environment, run the command `pip install sightreadinggenerator-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl` where the x's are replaced with your version number. This should be the file name of one of the files you downloaded. You have now successfully downloaded SightReadingGenerator as a python package. To use it, see example programs in the `examples` folder.
